## üöÄOptimizations

- **Web Vitals**: Improved the application performance by optimizing the `First Contentful Paint (FCP)` and `Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)` scores according to Web Vitals standards. This was achieved by compressing assets and serving them through `Cloudinary CDN`. Additionally, optimized the overall page load time by implementing `preloading`, `preconnect`, `lazy loading`, and `client-side caching` techniques using `RTK Query`. Furthermore, enhanced the search input functionality by integrating `debouncing`.
- **Dynamic Form Validation**: Utilized `React Hook Form` along with `Zod` to handle complex file and dynamic element validations, preventing unwanted re-rendering of form fields.
- **Custom Components and Higher-Order Components**: Designed custom hooks and higher-order components from scratch
